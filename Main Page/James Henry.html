    <h1 style = color:darkred> About Me</h1><br>
    <p>Hello! My name is James Henry and I am a sophomore chemical engineer at the University of Buffalo. I'm from Buffalo, NY, specifically Hamburg, which is roughly 15 minutes from the Bills stadium. Some hobbies I have are listening to music, such as Kendrick Lamar and Freddie Gibbs, playing rugby and browsing Tik-Tok. I'm apart of the Chi Beta Pledge class and have been enjoying the process of pledging Theta Tau!</p>

    <h1 style = color:darkred>My Pledge Process</h1>
    <h3 style = color:#f0ad4e>Constuction Process</h3>
    <p style =color:#000000>While going through the construction project I learned how to use many tools ranging from the bandsaw and the wallsaw in the woodshop to the drill and handsaw while assembling the letters. Next, while assembling the letters, the amount of sanding that was needed was disregarded. We found the sanding to take the most time and it was very hard to get extremely smooth. Throughout this process, our communication at the end increased immenesly from the beginning of the process. We were struggling as a group to communicate for this process, but learning from our mistakes we worked on and improved our communication.</p> 
    <h3 style = color:#f0ad4e >Coding Project</h3>
    <p style =color:#000000>I found this project ran more smoothly, as we were more comfortable as a class and created an approach to designing this website. I found myself learning how to code in HTML and how to add pictures to the code. Aside from this, I learned the base of  VScode and GitHub, along with user stories and tasks for working on the code. As a group, I feel we worked very well as a group, as our computer science majors helped us engineer majors learn and understand some code. </p> 
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1 style = color:darkred>Future Goals</h1>
    <p><ul style=“list-style-type:square”>

      <li>My first goal I have for myself is to graduate college with a 3.5 gpa. Chemical engineering can be a difficult major, but if I stay on top of my work, I believe I can accomplish this goal.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Another goal I have is to not only grow in the academic field, but as a person as well. I believe as I get older, I change as a person, and I want to change in a way where I can be at my "best self". This goal is definitely long term, but it's one I care a lot about and really want to focus on.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Finally, I want to pursue a master's degree in the chemical field, specifically the nuclear side. I'm still not sure if that's the degree I want, but it's definitely a thought that has been on my mind for post-undergraduate.</li>
      
      </ul></p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1 style = color:darkred>Job Interests</h1>
      <p><ul style=“list-style-type:square”>

        <li>First, I'm interested in a job working in a nuclear power plant, as a nuclear engineer. I've always wanted to work this job since I was a kid, and I think nuclear power and energy can be extremely beneficial if we can find efficient ways to gain and use it.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Another job interest I have is instead of nuclear engineer, working as a process engineer in a food factory. This job interest is extremely specific, but growing up near General Mills, I've always found an interest towards woring in food as an engineer.  </li>
        <br>
        <li>Finally, I had the idea of working in gas and oil, as a petroleum engineer. The idea of extracting oil, and doing it efficiently and in ways to maximize has always been extremely interesting to me. I definitely want to look more into petroleum engineering and how it relates to chemical engineering.</li>
