      <h1 style = color:darkred>About Me</h1><br>
      <p style =color:#000000>Hello! My name is Hao Zhu, and I am a Computer Science sophomore transfer student of the Chi Beta pledge class at the University at Buffalo. I transferred to UB this semester from The City College of New York because I felt that I needed to break out of the comfort of my home. I was raised in Brooklyn, NY, but I moved to Staten Island, NY two years ago. Some of my hobbies include digital art as well as listening to music. I hope to one day achieve my dream of becoming a software engineer.</p>
      <p style =color:#000000>Linked below are my resume and LinkedIn Profile. Feel free to connect with me through them!</p>

      <h1 style = color:darkred>My Pledging Experience</h1>
        <h3 style = color:#f0ad4e >Construction</h3>
        <p style =color:#000000>During the cutting phase of the construction project, I learned to make use of different tools in the woodshop, like the table saw, band saw, wall saw, and chop saw. Coordination during this phase was crucial as well, and I improved my time management skills by working out time slots with my pledge brothers to see who can go to the woodshop and who can stay at lab staffing. During the assembling phase of the construction project, I learned the intricate details on how the pieces of wood are put together. Before this I never thought about what goes inside a structure to make it stable, and I learned that supports were put inside. During the painting phase, I learned that it takes multiple coats of paint for the intended shade of a color to show when it dries.</p>
        <h3 style = color:#f0ad4e >Coding</h3>
        <p style =color:#000000>Currently, me and my pledge brothers are working together to bring this website to fruition. I enjoyed working with my computer science pledge brothers as well as guiding my non computer science pledge brothers on how to work on the pages of the site. This was the first time I used GitHub, Visual Studio Code, as well as Bootstrap, so I learned something new from my peers as well. What you see currently is the culmination of our dedicated time and hard work.</p>
        <h3 style = color:#f0ad4e >Brotherhood</h3>
        <p style =color:#000000>Before the pledge process, I didn't know a lot of people up here in Buffalo because this was my first semester here. Going through the pledging process allowed me to meet people that I believe I would be friends with for a lifetime. The nine of us shared triumphs and sorrows while working together through presentations, fundraising, and projects. We always had each other's backs when any of us were struggling, and we formed a tight bond together as a pledge class.</p>
        <h3 style = color:#f0ad4e >Being the Scribe</h3>
        <p style =color:#000000>As the Scribe of our pledge class, I am responsible for taking notes on what occurs during our chapter and pledge meetings. Additionally, I send out reminders to my pledge brothers about upcoming events as well as important dates that we should know. I have also created answer keys to our quizzes for my pledge brothers who are struggling to remember the material.</p>
      </ul></p>

      <h1 style = color:darkred>Job Interests</h1>
      <p><ul>
        <li style =color:#000000>Currently, I am most interested in becoming a software engineer. I have always enjoyed watching others create new programs and solve problems with code, and I would like to be in their shoes in the future.</li>
        <br>
        <li style =color:#000000>Another career I am interested in is game design. I started playing video games at a very early age and I've always been curious about how certain mechanics are implemented, like how the player interacts with the virtual environment or how objects are rendered in the game while playing, which blossomed my passion in this field. </li>
        <br>
        <li style =color:#000000>Since starting this website project, I realized that I am interested in doing UI/UX design as well. I have enjoyed working on this project with my pledge brothers and working out how the website looks and feels to the eyes of the user.</li>
