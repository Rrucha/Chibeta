    <h1 style = color:#00609c>About Me</h1><br> 
    <p style = color:#000000>Hi! My name is Isabella (or Bella) and I'm a sophomore majoring in electrical engineering. I was born in Virginia but have lived in Buffalo since I was 4 years old. In my free time I like swimming, playing on my phone, and drawing. I especially love hanging out with my friends including the new ones OT has given me. I enjoy listening to NAV, Frank Ocean, Taylor Swift, and 88 Rising.   </p> <break></break>

    <h1 style = color:#00609c>During the Pledge Process</h1>
    <h3 style =color:#35a1d7 >Construction</h3>
    <p>Before the construction project, the closet thing to a power tool I've ever picked up is a hand mixer. My pledge brothers were so helpful in taking time not only to explain how each tool works, but why that specific tool was needed for each part. Zach taught me how to use a hand drill and drill press while Anna taught me how to use multiple saws in the woodshop. I also used wood putty and learned that although it's good for small cracks, its not meant to be used to repalce an entire corner. Through the many late nights, our pledge class was able to improve our teamwork skills as well as bond over staying up until 5am to paint another layer on the letters.</p> 
    <h3 style =color:#35a1d7 >Coding</h3>
    <p>As a non CS major, I went into this project not knowing how to code anything. As someone who has always been interested in SWE and CS, I was super excited to get this project. My CS pledge brothers were super helpful in explaining how to push/pull code; change the size, color, and font of texts; and how to insert photos. Ary was especially patient and would pick up all my facetime calls, set up zoom and discord calls, and would meet up with me to help me not only learn how to code, but would stop to ask if I knew why he did each thing. This projet has definately been my favorite and I loved seeing it come together in the end. </p> 
    <h3 style =color:#35a1d7 >Professional Development</h3>
    <p>Throughout the process, my skills in terms of professional development have grown. Having to create/work on a presentation each week has taught me how to create a presentation that's clear, efficient, and aesthetically pleasing. My public speaking has also improved. Although I still talk fast when I present, I feel that I now speak slower and that my speech consist of less breaks. Applying for internships was a big thing for me too. Having to apply really pushed me into the next steps of my career and will help me to explore what I want to do in the future. </p> 
    <h3 style =color:#35a1d7 >Brotherhood</h3>
    <p>I can say without a doubt that the best thing I've gotten out of this pledge process are the bonds and friendships I've created. </p> 
    <h3 style =color:#35a1d7 >Overall</h3>
    <p style = color:#000000> The pledge process has been full of hard work, but has also helped me to grow as a person and develop my skill set. Through the different projects such as the construction of our 3D letters, I learned how to cut wood using various saws, work with my pledge brothers to coordinate our schedules, and construct the letters using various drills. By creating and presenting presentations every week, my skills in public speaking, formatting, and teamwork have grown. The pledge process has given me new friends that I know will be with me for life. They make me laugh, make sure I'm taking care of myself, and are there for me whenever I need. Having almost completed the process, I can't wait to see where I am as a person after it's over!
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1 style = color:#00609c>Future Goals/Plans</h1>
      <p style = color:#000000> Sometime in the next two years, I want to study abroad. I've always wanted to see what the world has to offer and studying abroad allows me to explore the world while I work towards my degree. I plan on graduating the University at Buffalo with a BS in electrical engineering. After that, I plan on doing whatever life takes me, whether it's going for my masters or beginning a new job. Growing up in a world full of technology, software and A.I. are things that have peaked my interest. I plan on exploring fields and learning what jobs will allows me to combine EE with them.

    <p style = color:#000000> I love taking pictures and videos and documenting everything. Below are a few pictures that I've taken or have been in during the pledge process :) </p>
