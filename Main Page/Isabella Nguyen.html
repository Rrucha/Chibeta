    <h1 style = color:darkred>About Me</h1><br> 
    <p style = color:#000000> Hi! My name is Isabella (or Bella) and I'm a sophomore majoring in electrical engineering. I was born in Fairfax, VA, but have lived in Buffalo, NY since I was 4 years old. I’m a virgo, Vietnamese-American, and am obsessed with taking photos and vlogs. If you see me, I'm probably on my phone, hanging out with my friends, or in Capen somewhere. I love doing things for the fun of it and can't wait to take you guys through my pledge process with this page!  </p> <break></break>
    <h3 style = color:#f0ad4e> Hobbies</h3>
    <p2><ul>
      <li style =color:#000000>I love to paint and draw. It allows me to express how I feel and helps me to pass time when I’m bored. All of my papers and notebooks have a doodle somewhere on them. I draw flowers, stars, and hearts the most. </li>
      <br>
      <li style =color:#000000> Some people like to call me an iPad kid because I'm on my phone all the time. That's because I love to record and take pictures of everything. My recent obsession has been my film camera that I always leave in my car in case I go somewhere or do something. My plan is to develop and print out all of the pcitures I've taken or have been in and create a photo album at the end of the pledge prcoess.  </li>
      <br>
      <li style =color:#000000>One of my favorite sports has to be swimming. I was on the varsity swim team all throughout high school. There’s something about being in the water that puts me in a state of serenity.</li>
      </ul></p>

    <h3 style = color:#f0ad4e> Fun Facts</h3>
    <p2><ul>
      <li style =color:#000000>I'm one out of thirteen grandchildren. Out of all thirteen, I'm the only one who's left-handed and one out of two who don't need glasses.</li>
      <br>
      <li style =color:#000000> I pledged Theta Tau because I decided I needed a change of pace in my life and though it would be fun to join something new. All of my friends were either medical or business and I figured Theta Tau would be the perfect place to meet engineers and make new friends as well as develop my professional skills.</li>
      <br>
      <li style =color:#000000>If you met me last year, you would've never heard me say the words girly pop or slay. My friends got me hooked on those words over summer and I've gotten the entire pledge class as well as some brothers to use the word slay and girly pop in their vocabularies. </li>
      </ul></p>

    <h1 style = color:darkred>During the Pledge Process</h1>
    <h3 style = color:#f0ad4e >Construction</h3>
    <p style =color:#000000>Before the construction project, the closest thing to a power tool I've ever picked up is a hand mixer. My pledge brothers were so helpful in taking time not only to explain how each tool works, but why that specific tool was needed for each part. Zach taught me how to use a hand drill and drill press and Anna taught me how to use multiple saws in the woodshop. I also used wood putty and learned that although it's good for small cracks, it's not meant to be used to replace an entire corner. Through the many late nights, our pledge class was able to improve our teamwork skills as well as bond over staying up until 5am to paint another layer on the letters. </p> 
    <h3 style = color:#f0ad4e >Coding</h3>
    <p style =color:#000000>As a non CS major, I went into this project not knowing how to code anything. My CS pledge brothers were super helpful in explaining how to push/pull code; change the size, color, and font of texts; and how to insert photos. Ary and Hao were especially patient and would pick up all my facetime calls, set up zoom and discord calls, and would meet up with me to help me not only learn how to code, but would stop to make sure I understood everything. After completing this project, I've learned how to insert and resize photos as well as the syntax for html. For example, < br > stands for break, < h > stands for headings and adding a number after h changes the size of the heading, and style= changes the color of the text. I used < h3 > in order to format the headings of this section. This project has definitely been my favorite and I loved seeing it come together in the end. </p> 
    <h3 style = color:#f0ad4e >Professional Development</h3>
    <p style =color:#000000>Throughout the process, my skills in terms of professional development have grown. Having to create/work on a presentation each week has taught me how to create a presentation that's clear, efficient, and aesthetically pleasing. My public speaking has also improved. Although I still talk fast when I present, I feel that I now speak slower and that my speech consists of fewer breaks. Applying for internships was a big thing for me too. Having to apply really pushed me into the next steps of my career and will help me to explore what I want to do in the future. </p> 
    <h3 style = color:#f0ad4e >Brotherhood</h3>
    <p style =color:#000000>I can say without a doubt that one of the best things I've gotten out of this pledge process are the bonds and friendships I've created; they're the type that'll last you a lifetime. Some of these people have seen me uncontrollably laugh up to the point where I die, have helped me through my mini mental breakdowns, and have supported me in every decision I make (even if they're questionable). I'm especially grateful that they make sure I'm taking care of myself and I love that I can joke around and talk with them about anything I need. </p> 

    <br>
    <br>
    <h1 style = color:darkred>Future Goals/Plans</h1>
    <p style = color:#000000>  Sometime in the next two years, I want to study abroad. I've always wanted to see what the world has to offer and studying abroad allows me to explore the world while I work towards my degree. I plan on graduating from the University at Buffalo with a BS in electrical engineering. After that, I plan on doing whatever life takes me, whether it's going for my masters or beginning a new job. Growing up in a world full of technology, software and A.I. are things that have peaked my interest. I plan on exploring fields and learning what jobs will allow me to combine EE with them.</p> 
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1 style = color:darkred>Pictures</h1>
    <p style = color:#000000> I love taking pictures and videos and documenting everything. Below are a few pictures that I've taken or have been in during the pledge process :) </p>
