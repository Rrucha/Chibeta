    <h1 style = color:darkred>About Me</h1><br>
    <p>My name is Aryaman Ghosh and I'm a Computer Science major in my Junior year. Even though I've moved through a lot of places in my life I would still call India my home. My name "Aryaman" means the person who won the sun, this was interesting to me since I have always have been a person who loves a good sunny day. I've been through many cultures and cities in my life, however I recognise myself the most as a Bengali. Being a person who is very intriged by new things and places from a very young age has brought me to the US for my undergraduate program, this is mostly because of my supportive parents without whom I wouldn't be the person I'm today. </p>

    <h1 style = color:darkred>During the Pledge Process</h1>
    <h3 style = color:#f0ad4e >Construction</h3>
    <p style =color:#000000>I only had a little construction experience; even when we used to have new furniture come into my house, my family used to have people come in to assemble it for us. Even when my house needed to drill something in, we would have people come over to help drill into the wall, so when I was asked to make 4 feet tall 3D letters with my PBs, I was agitated since I didn't know the first thing about cutting wood or even using any tools. However, throughout the process of us building the letters, with the help of my fellow PB's, I made sure that I committed myself to creating the letters and honestly had a lot of fun building them. Zach had made sure that all the PB's safely used all the power tools and learned how to use the power tools along the way. The feeling of walking into home depot with wood shaving all over me made me feel very powerful in a weird way. So, the construction project helped me become very independent. </p> 
    <h3 style = color:#f0ad4e >Coding</h3>
    <p style =color:#000000>Being a Junior in Computer Science had come into play for the website coding project. I love to make frontend UI/UX architecture for websites in my free time, so I took the opportunity to make the website's skeleton. I made the website's structure such that my fellow engineering PB's had enough space to learn to code at their own pace without too many hiccups. I also made sure to help my engineering PB's along the way in coding any part of the website. My fellow computer science PB's also ensured that the website's structure was presentable. We faced many problems, such as multiple merge conflicts, mainly because we were working at our own pace, and hence sometimes would need to find out if the website had any changes in the code. Therefore I took this opportunity to explain to my PB's who are not computer science majors about merge conflicts and how to avoid them. As a pledge class, we also worked up a mechanism to make sure that we put in our chat that one of us had "pushed" a new change in the code every time we would push. Overall I had a lot of fun working with a passionate team of PB's who wanted to learn how to code and amazing Computer Science PB's who helped all of the engineering PB's along the way. </p> 
    <h3 style = color:#f0ad4e >Professional Development</h3>
    <p style =color:#000000>I have seen my dad in corporate life throughout my entire life, and hence I saw from a very early age that professionalism and discipline are very important in a workplace. That being said, Theta Tau has helped me bring out that discipline in my life that I needed. I was following a row of tasks given to a team of people that I had never met before in my life. This helped me build my team-building skills and professional skills since I had to professionally talk to the brothers during the meetings and make sure that I talked to my team of pledge brothers about making professional presentations that can be presented with the clarity of mind. One of the most useful professional development workshops that we had was our resumes, where I learned that my resume was not ideal and hence was mainly the reason why I was not hearing back from recruiters. Thus, I ended up improving my resume significantly. In conclusion, I have grown professionally, and I believe Theta Tau in the future will help me prepare for the professional world. </p> 
    <h3 style = color:#f0ad4e >Conclusion</h3>
    <p style =color:#000000>When people in the future ask me about my pledge process, my one-word reply would be "Life Changing." This is mainly because I've been brought up in a way where I never had to do anything myself; everything was either handed to me or done for me; hence, the pledge process was very refreshing. I learned how to use power tools, which I never thought I would know how to use. This is a significant change since, last semester, I could not even do simple plumbing jobs, but this semester, I learned how to operate heavy machinery and everyday power tools. The essence of teamwork with strangers who have become my friends for life was also something I liked about the pledge process. In conclusion, the pledge process has helped me realize that if I put my mind to something, I can do it. </p>

    <h1 style = color:darkred>My Hobbies</h1>
      <p><ul>

        <li>I'm a big music person. I've always been into music from a very young age; I learned how to play the clarinet and trumpet in 4th grade, and I also participated in a musical in 5th grade called "The Lemonade Kid." However, for me today, I've become a person who appreciates a lot of different genres of music. My favorite artists include Tyler the Creator, Drake, Frank Ocean, Tame Impala, and Nav.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Sports such as soccer and cricket are something I love to play and watch as well in my free time. My favorite soccer team in any league is Liverpool, and my favorite cricket team is the national team of India since we have an excellent cricket team. I'm also a big believer in growing; hence I've started to give American football a chance, I've begun to understand the game a little bit, but I love the atmosphere it creates. My favorite American football team right now is the bills.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Editing videos is another thing I'm huge on. I love to make a video look very aesthetically pleasing. I usually make sure that the video is small and crisp to watch and that the quality of the video is also very high definition. I started my editing journey after watching my favorite YouTubers, such as MKBHD and Casey Niestat. And obviously, my favorite YouTuber of all time is KSI for content motivation.</li>
