    <h1>About Me</h1><br>
    <p>My name is Aryaman Ghosh and I'm a Computer Science major in my Junior year. Even though I've moved through a lot of places in my life I would still call India my home. My name "Aryaman" means the person who won the sun, this was interesting to me since I have always have been a person who loves a good sunny day. I've been through many cultures and cities in my life, however I recognise myself the most as a Bengali. Being a person who is very intriged by new things and places from a very young age has brought me to the US for my undergraduate program, this is mostly because of my supportive parents without whom I wouldn't be the person I'm today. </p>
    <p>Feel free to look at my resume as well as connect with me on Linkedin.</p>

    <h1 style = color:darkred>During the Pledge Process</h1>
    <h3 style = color:#f0ad4e >Construction</h3>
    <p style =color:#000000>Before the construction project, the closest thing to a power tool I've ever picked up is a hand mixer. My pledge brothers were so helpful in taking time not only to explain how each tool works, but why that specific tool was needed for each part. Zach taught me how to use a hand drill and drill press and Anna taught me how to use multiple saws in the woodshop. I also used wood putty and learned that although it's good for small cracks, it's not meant to be used to replace an entire corner. Through the many late nights, our pledge class was able to improve our teamwork skills as well as bond over staying up until 5am to paint another layer on the letters. </p> 
    <h3 style = color:#f0ad4e >Coding</h3>
    <p style =color:#000000>As a non CS major, I went into this project not knowing how to code anything. My CS pledge brothers were super helpful in explaining how to push/pull code; change the size, color, and font of texts; and how to insert photos. Ary and Hao were especially patient and would pick up all my FaceTime calls, set up Zoom and Discord calls, and would meet up with me to help me not only learn how to code, but would stop to make sure I understood everything. After completing this project, I've learned how to insert and resize photos as well as the syntax for html. For example, < br > stands for break, < h > stands for headings and adding a number after h changes the size of the heading, and style= changes the color of the text. I used < h3 > in order to format the headings of this section. This project has definitely been my favorite and I loved seeing it come together in the end. </p> 
    <h3 style = color:#f0ad4e >Professional Development</h3>
    <p style =color:#000000>Throughout the process, my skills in terms of professional development have grown. Having to create/work on a presentation each week has taught me how to create a presentation that's clear, efficient, and aesthetically pleasing. My public speaking has also improved. Although I still talk fast when I present, I feel that I now speak slower and that my speech consists of fewer breaks. Applying for internships was a big thing for me too. Having to apply really pushed me into the next steps of my career and will help me to explore what I want to do in the future. The resume workshop was extremely helpful in helping me reformat my resume which I used to apply to internships. </p> 
    <h3 style = color:#f0ad4e >Conclusion</h3>
    <p style =color:#000000>When people in the future ask me about my pledge process, my one-word reply would be "Life Changing." This is mainly because I've been brought up in a way where I never had to do anything myself; everything was either handed to me or done for me; hence, the pledge process was very refreshing. I learned how to use power tools, which I never thought I would know how to use. This is a significant change since, last semester, I could not even do simple plumbing jobs, but this semester, I learned how to operate heavy machinery and everyday power tools. The essence of teamwork with strangers who have become my friends for life was also something I liked about the pledge process. In conclusion, the pledge process has helped me realize that if I put my mind to something, I can do it. </p>

    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
      <p><ul style=“list-style-type:square”>

        <li>I'm a big music person. I've always been into music from a very young age; I learned how to play the clarinet and trumpet in 4th grade, and I also participated in a musical in 5th grade called "The Lemonade Kid." However, for me today, I've become a person who appreciates a lot of different genres of music. My favorite artists include Tyler the Creator, Drake, Frank Ocean, Tame Impala, and Nav.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Sports such as soccer and cricket are something I love to play and watch as well in my free time. My favorite soccer team in any league is Liverpool, and my favorite cricket team is the national team of India since we have an excellent cricket team. I'm also a big believer in growing; hence I've started to give American football a chance, I've begun to understand the game a little bit, but I love the atmosphere it creates. My favorite American football team right now is the bills.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Editing videos is another thing I'm huge on. I love to make a video look very aesthetically pleasing. I usually make sure that the video is small and crisp to watch and that the quality of the video is also very high definition. I started my editing journey after watching my favorite YouTubers, such as MKBHD and Casey Niestat. And obviously, my favorite YouTuber of all time is KSI for content motivation.</li>
