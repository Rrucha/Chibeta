    <h1>About Me</h1><br>
    <p>My name is Aryaman Ghosh and I'm a Computer Science major in my Junior year. Even though I've moved through a lot of places in my life I would still call India my home. My name "Aryaman" means the person who won the sun, this was interesting to me since I have always have been a person who loves a good sunny day. I've been through many cultures and cities in my life, however I recognise myself the most as a Bengali. Being a person who is very intriged by new things and places from a very young age has brought me to the US for my undergraduate program, this is mostly because of my supportive parents without whom I wouldn't be the person I'm today. </p>

    <h1>My Pledge Process Experience</h1>
    <p>When people in the future ask me about my pledge process, my one-word reply would be "Life Changing." This is mainly because I've been brought up in a way where I never had to do anything myself; everything was either handed to me or done for me; hence, the pledge process was very refreshing. I learned how to use power tools, which I never thought I would know how to use. This is a significant change since, last semester, I could not even do simple plumbing jobs, but this semester, I learned how to operate heavy machinery and everyday power tools. The essence of teamwork with strangers who have become my friends for life was also something I liked about the pledge process. In conclusion, the pledge process has helped me realize that if I put my mind to something, I can do it.</p>

    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
      <p><ul style=“list-style-type:square”>

        <li>I'm a big music person. I've always been into music from a very young age; I learned how to play the clarinet and trumpet in 4th grade, and I also participated in a musical in 5th grade called "The Lemonade Kid." However, for me today, I've become a person who appreciates a lot of different genres of music. My favorite artists include Tyler the Creator, Drake, Frank Ocean, Tame Impala, and Nav.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Another goal I have is to not only grow in the academic field, but as a person as well. I believe as I get older, I change as a person, and I want to change in a way where I can be at my "best self". This goal is definitely long term, but it's one I care a lot about and really want to focus on.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Finally, I want to pursue a master's degree in the chemical field, specifically the nuclear side. I'm still not sure if that's the degree I want, but it's definitely a thought that has been on my mind for post-undergraduate.</li>
