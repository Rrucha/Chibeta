  <h1>My Pledge Process Experience</h1>
  <p>When people in the future ask me about my pledge process, my one-word reply would be "Life Changing." This is mainly because I've been brought up in a way where I never had to do anything myself; everything was either handed to me or done for me; hence, the pledge process was very refreshing. I learned how to use power tools, which I never thought I would know how to use. This is a significant change since, last semester, I could not even do simple plumbing jobs, but this semester, I learned how to operate heavy machinery and everyday power tools. The essence of teamwork with strangers who have become my friends for life was also something I liked about the pledge process. In conclusion, the pledge process has helped me realize that if I put my mind to something, I can do it.</p>

  <h1>My Hobbies</h1>

      <li>I'm a big music person. I've always been into music from a very young age; I learned how to play the clarinet and trumpet in 4th grade, and I also participated in a musical in 5th grade called "The Lemonade Kid." However, for me today, I've become a person who appreciates a lot of different genres of music. My favorite artists include Tyler the Creator, Drake, Frank Ocean, Tame Impala, and Nav.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Sports such as soccer and cricket are something I love to play and watch as well in my free time. My favorite soccer team in any league is Liverpool, and my favorite cricket team is the national team of India since we have an excellent cricket team. I'm also a big believer in growing; hence I've started to give American football a chance, I've begun to understand the game a little bit, but I love the atmosphere it creates. My favorite American football team right now is the bills.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Editing videos is another thing I'm huge on. I love to make a video look very aesthetically pleasing. I usually make sure that the video is small and crisp to watch and that the quality of the video is also very high definition. I started my editing journey after watching my favorite YouTubers, such as MKBHD and Casey Niestat. And obviously, my favorite YouTuber of all time is KSI for content motivation.</li>
