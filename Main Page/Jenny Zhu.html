    <p class="lead">Hello! I am Jenny Zhu, and I am an Electrical Engineering sophomore, as well as Chi Beta Pledge, at the University at Buffalo. I am from NYC, Staten Island, howeveer, I was raised in Brooklyn. 
      I attended CCNY pursing my Bachelor's of Architecture degree in freshman year, in aspiration to become an licensed architect. Throughout a semester of testing waters, I figured architecture was no the right subject for me. 
      It was not as technical as I would have thought it was. I transferred to University at Buffalo beginning of my sophomore year to pursue my Electrical Engineering degreee. 
      I still love to travel to different musuems and appreciate the art. Speaking of which, over Summer 2022, I studied abroad in Paris where I studuied Psychoanalysis and the Visual Arts. In the career outlooks, I am looking to work in the field of construction as an electrical engineer. </p>

        <h3 style = color:#f0ad4e> Construction Project</h3>
          <p class="lead"> I was able to incorporate my knowledge on AutoCAD from being in the Architecture major. 
            Stepping into the our first teamwork project, the Construction project, communication was a major issue within our pledge class. I had different opinions on the plans of cutting out wood with one of my pledge brothers. I was obstinate and unwilling to hearing them out. 
            Throughout various meetings throughout the project, my pledge class worked with me to figure things out. 
            Now I am able to sit thorugh with them and keep an open mind to what is being offered to the table. Other than working on keeping an open mind, I was able take lead with Anna in Mechancial Engineering major to teach and guide the rest of our pledge class through the usage of power tools to painting the letters. 
            I was able to dip my toes into how it would be like to converse people that are not within the construction field and would need to give my explanations and directions in a more concise method.

        <h3 style = color:#f0ad4e> Coding Project</h3>
        <br>
        <p class="lead"> As an engineer major, coding is not in my specialty. 
          My pledge brothers guided me through the installation of Visual Studio Code and assisted me in beginning with the basics to get started on the coding part. 
          For instance: h tags are for headings and numbering 1 through 6 would change the size of the text, div tags which divides sections or acts as a container for a certain sytle or element, br tags are used to put breaks within the text, and href tag which links a page to a a set container. 
          As a result of this, we are able to present the website in front of you right now. We were also able to improve on our communcations within this project. Improved communication prevented merge coflicts that could occur throughout the duration of this project. 
          The task delegation was also more reasonable to avoid overwhelming the computer science majors.  </p>

        <h3 style = color:#f0ad4e> Professional Development</h3>
        <p class="lead"> From the time management pledge project, I was able to see where my week worth of 168 hours went into. 
          By planning my day ahead of time, I was able to check in on myself to make sure that I am accomplishing the tasks set for the day. 
          From planning ahead, I was able to do a better job on keeping track of time. Other than the pledge project, Firm tours were beneficial to me. 
          From the firm tours at Cannon Design and Foit Albert, I was more certain of what field I would like to work in, and I was able to ask questions on the what needs to be done to get there. 
          Last but not least, weekly presentations on progress checks helped me become more comfortable presenting in front of crowds.
