    <p>Hello! I am Zachary Clark, and I am a Civil Engineering sophomore and PCP of the Chi Beta Pledge Class, at the University at Buffalo. Some interesting facts about me are that I have lived in 4 different states, including Michigan, where I was born, Wyoming, and Nebraska. My hobbies include hiking, camping, backpacking, and pretty much anything outdoors. I also really enjoy music of any type and enjoy nature photography. I have been enjoying the pledging process and getting closer to my fellow PB's. </p>

    <h1 style = color:darkred>During the Pledge Process</h1>
    <h3 style = color:#f0ad4e >Construction</h3>
    <p style =color:#000000> The construction process was by far the most stressful part of the pledging process. Learning to work together with my pledge brothers and resolving our communication issues at the beginning of this process created many close bonds and ties between us. During the construction portion of the process,  many of my fellow PB’s had very limited to no experience using power tools, hand tools, saws, or any sort of wood working experience. Because of this, I became the go to person to help teach and help my fellow PB’s learn how to use hand and power tools throughout the construction phase of the process. I taught how to use hand drills, how sanding blocks work, how to sand, how to use table saws, etc. My general experience in wood working and construction allowed me to share a variety of skills and workarounds and solutions to many of the problems we faced, and I was very glad to be able to share my knowledge to my fellow PBs. During this phase I also learned some new skills and knowledge myself. Anna had the great and unique idea of trying to use pocket holes for assembly on the letters, even though it did not work as expected because of the thickness of the plywood, I learned new techniques and tools to use in the future. This phase of the process, even though it was incredibly stressful overall, created a long lasting bond between me and my fellow PB’s, as staying up for long hours constructing and sanding the letters, pulling all-nighters, spending most of all our free time together made us grow very close, and is definitely what made this project worth the time and effort that we put in. </p> 
    <h3 style = color:#f0ad4e >Coding</h3>
    <p style =color:#000000>The coding project as a much less stressful project overall, and it was highly enjoyable for me because of the amount of new material and information I was able to learn from my fellow PB’s. Ary, Hao, Lydia, and Rrucha took the lead explaining to us the CSS code which they were building and the templates they were giving us and explaining us how to format our Gallery and PNM pages. After going through how the website works and how to build our own PNM pages. After showing us the basics, they let us explore and work on our own pages, being available often to help us with issues that we were having, fixing bugs, and teaching us more advanced html code throughout the process. I personally had a little experience using basic html before, but never how to use git hub or VSC before. They taught me how to use both programs and how they worked, and helped us all learn how to code basic html and made us all feel comfortable working on our pages alone while only needing to help us when issues or bugs we couldn’t solve on our own came up. Our computer science PB’s really stepped up during this part of the process and taught the rest of us many useful and new skills when it comes to coding. It was really rewarding to be able to learn so much from my other PB’s after teaching them a ton of new skills and ideas during the construction process.  </p> 
    <h3 style = color:#f0ad4e >Professional Development</h3>
    <p style =color:#000000>During the process, my professional development skills definitely improved. From the multiple presentations and events we hosted, I was able to hone in and improve on many of my issues that comes with public speaking. Specifically, my main skills I improved upon and were critiqued on was the speed on which I spoke and my mannerisms while presenting. Throughout the process I become aware when I was speaking too fast and made active attempts to slow down my speech. I also became very conscious of my mannerisms that were unprofessional, such as having my hands in my pockets during my presentations or stuttering during presentations. Another skill which is much less obvious outwardly is how I managed my anxiety while public speaking. I learned several soft skills to help me manage my anxiety while presenting and have been actively employing them during my presentations. Ultimately the process has better prepared me and made me better at public speaking and presenting myself in a professional manner.   </p> 
    <h3 style =color:#f0ad4e > Conclusion </h3>
    <p style =color:#000000> During the pledge process, the greatest challenge was communication between us. Formulating and organzing a way to communicate as a group consistently and constantly was the most difficult but also rewarding part of the process. Our communication skills improved drasticaly throughout the process and helped us develop those skills both professionally and personally and was extrememly rewarding to develop this skill. My favorite part about the entire process was developing close bonds with my fellow pledge brothers and solving problems through teamwork and communication. We've all become very close friends and have been there for each other throughout the process through highs and lows, dealing with not only pledging stresses but also many personal issues that effected us. Working through and helping each other through these problems created the type of connections and friendships that last for a lifetime.</p>

    <h1 style = color:darkred>My Job Interests</h1><br>
      <p>On top of outdoor activitites, I am also a giant history buff, already having a B.A. in History. With my current academic path, I hope to use the combination of degrees in hopes to find employment in the field of architectural preservation and restoration. History has played an important part in my life and I would love the opportunity to incorporate my love of history into a career in engineering.</p>
